# Hello There

### I find that the title of Web Generalist best applies to what I do for a living.

During the last 17 years, Iâ€™ve worked as a designer, front-end developer, project manager, and content strategist. I'm also a writer and designer living and working in Louisville, Kentucky. My beautiful wife and I have three lovable cats and watch Netflix now and then. Nice to meet you.

This is the code for my personal website, obviously.
