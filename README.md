# Hello There

### I practice relentless optimism

Technology can make the world a better place if the humans who use it are carefully considered. I firmly believe in this goal and work toward it every day. For the past 20 years, Iâ€™ve worked as a designer, developer, content strategist, and product manager. While I have a wide range of technical experience, I consider empathy and communication to be my most valuable skills.

This is the code for my personal website, obviously.
